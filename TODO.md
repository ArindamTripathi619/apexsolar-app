# ApexSolar App - TODO List

## ðŸ”„ Current Task: Invoice Generator Integration

### High Priority: Integrate Invoice Generator Project
- [ ] **Analyze invoice-generator project structure and data models**
  - âœ… Reviewed project analysis report and codebase
  - âœ… Understood Supabase-based architecture and PDF generation
  - [ ] Map invoice-generator data schema to ApexSolar database schema
  
- [ ] **Design integration architecture**
  - [ ] Plan data synchronization between Supabase (invoice-generator) and PostgreSQL (main app)
  - [ ] Design API endpoints for cross-project communication
  - [ ] Plan automatic PDF upload workflow to main app's invoice section
  
- [ ] **Client data synchronization**
  - [ ] Map Customer model (invoice-generator) to Client model (main app)
  - [ ] Implement client data sync between projects
  - [ ] Handle duplicate detection and merging
  
- [ ] **Invoice data integration**
  - [ ] Auto-upload generated PDFs to main app's invoice section
  - [ ] Sync invoice amounts with client dues tracking
  - [ ] Maintain invoice metadata consistency
  
- [ ] **PDF generation integration**
  - [ ] Integrate jsPDF functionality into main app
  - [ ] Preserve existing PDF generation capabilities
  - [ ] Add invoice generation directly within main app
  
- [ ] **Workflow automation**
  - [ ] Automatic invoice creation workflow
  - [ ] Client dues update automation
  - [ ] Invoice number synchronization
  - [ ] Financial data consistency checks

### Integration Requirements Identified:

#### Invoice-Generator Project Current State:
- **Technology**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (cloud database)
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF + jspdf-autotable
- **Storage**: Local storage for drafts, Supabase for persistence
- **Features**: Invoice creation, customer management, invoice history, settings

#### Main App Integration Points:
- **Invoice Upload**: `/app/admin/invoices/page.tsx` - target for PDF uploads
- **Client Management**: `/app/admin/clients/` - sync customer data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Invoice and Client models
- **API**: `/api/invoices/` - extend for invoice generation

#### Data Mapping Required:
```
Invoice-Generator â†’ Main App
Customer â†’ Client
Invoice â†’ Invoice (with PDF auto-upload)
LineItem â†’ (new model or JSON field)
CompanySettings â†’ (app configuration)
```

#### Technical Challenges:
- [ ] Database migration: Supabase â†’ PostgreSQL
- [ ] Authentication integration
- [ ] File storage: Local â†’ Cloud storage
- [ ] API architecture: Frontend-only â†’ Full-stack
- [ ] Data format compatibility

#### Integration Strategy Options:
1. **Embed invoice-generator as component** (Recommended)
   - Integrate React components into main app
   - Replace Supabase with PostgreSQL API calls
   - Maintain existing UI and functionality
   
2. **Standalone integration with API bridge**
   - Keep invoice-generator separate
   - Create API bridge for data sync
   - Auto-upload PDFs to main app

3. **Complete rewrite within main app**
   - Recreate functionality using main app patterns
   - Direct database integration
   - Unified codebase

### Next Steps:
1. **Start with Option 1** - Component integration approach
2. **Create invoice generation section** within main app admin panel
3. **Migrate customer management** to use main app's Client model
4. **Implement PDF generation** using existing jsPDF setup
5. **Add automatic PDF upload** to invoice management system
6. **Sync financial data** with client dues tracking

## Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Batch operations for better efficiency
- [ ] Export functionality for reports

### Reporting Features
- [ ] Advanced financial reports
- [ ] Employee performance analytics
- [ ] Client payment analysis
- [ ] Monthly/yearly summaries

### System Enhancements
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Audit trail logging
- [ ] Advanced user permissions

All current core features are working. Focus is now on invoice generator integration.
