## Production Debug Strategy

### URGENT: Test This Immediately

**Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment, then:**

1. **Go to your production company settings page**
2. **Try uploading the company logo and signature again**
3. **Check if it works now** (should work since we removed authentication temporarily)

### Results Analysis:

**If it WORKS now:**
- ‚úÖ Confirms the issue is 100% authentication in production
- We need to fix authentication/JWT configuration
- Issues likely: JWT_SECRET missing, cookie domain/security settings

**If it STILL FAILS:**
- ‚ùå The issue is deeper - database, environment, or network problems
- Check production logs/console for specific error messages
- May need database connection or environment variable fixes

---

### Production Error Patterns to Look For:

**Browser Console (F12):**
- Look for error messages in Console tab
- Look for failed network requests in Network tab
- Check if request reaches `/api/company-settings` endpoint

**Common Production Issues:**
1. **Database connection problems** (DATABASE_URL incorrect)
2. **Missing environment variables** (JWT_SECRET, etc.)
3. **File size limits** (different in production vs development)
4. **CORS/domain issues** (if using different domains)
5. **Memory/timeout limits** (large file uploads)

---

### Next Steps Based on Test Results:

**If authentication was the issue:**
- Restore authentication but fix JWT configuration
- Add proper cookie settings for production domain
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in production environment

**If still broken:**
- Deep dive into production logs
- Check database connectivity
- Verify all environment variables are properly set

### Test Command for Production (after it works):
```bash
# This should work now in production
curl -X PUT "https://your-production-domain.com/api/company-settings" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "accountName": "APEX SOLAR",
    "bankName": "STATE BANK OF INDIA",
    "ifscCode": "SBIN0007679", 
    "accountNumber": "40423372674",
    "gstNumber": "19AFZPT2526E1ZV"
  }'
```

üö® **IMPORTANT**: This is a temporary fix - we'll restore authentication once we identify the root cause!
