# ApexSolar App - TODO Items

## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED (January 2025)

### 🔒 Critical Security Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Admin routes were accessible without authentication
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. API authentication temporarily disabled in production testing
  2. No Next.js middleware for frontend route protection  
  3. Missing client-side auth checks on admin pages
- **Solution**: 
  1. ✅ Re-enabled API authentication in `/api/clients`
  2. ✅ Created comprehensive Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`)
  3. ✅ Added authentication checks to all admin pages
- **Security Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Complete unauthorized access prevention
- **Status**: 🔒 **FULLY SECURED** - All admin routes now properly protected

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Fixed dropdown overflow issue**: kWp quantity selector in Services/Products section
- ✅ **Enhanced responsive design**: Better mobile and desktop layouts
- ✅ **Improved form styling**: Consistent flexbox constraints and positioning

### 📚 Documentation Organization - COMPLETED
