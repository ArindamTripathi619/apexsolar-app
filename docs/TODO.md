# ApexSolar App - TODO Items

## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED (January 2025)

### 🎨 UI/UX & Privacy Improvements - COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Inconsistent button styling across the application and privacy concerns with public employee data
- **Solution**: 
  1. ✅ Created comprehensive ButtonComponent with 8 variants and 5 size options
  2. ✅ Updated admin dashboard, login pages, and home page with consistent styling
  3. ✅ Removed sensitive payment and attendance data from public employee profiles
  4. ✅ Enhanced document viewing with both "View" and "Download" options
  5. ✅ Maintained data integrity while protecting employee privacy via public URLs
- **Security Impact**: **HIGH** - Employee financial and attendance data no longer exposed through public links
- **UI Impact**: **HIGH** - Professional, consistent button styling throughout application
- **Status**: 🎨 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All buttons now follow design system, privacy protected

### 🔒 Critical Authentication Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Login was failing with Edge Runtime compatibility problems
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. .env file had Windows line endings preventing JWT_SECRET from loading properly
  2. Next.js middleware uses Edge Runtime which doesn't support Node.js crypto module
  3. jsonwebtoken library incompatible with Edge Runtime environment
- **Solution**: 
  1. ✅ Fixed .env file line endings using `tr -d '\r'`
  2. ✅ Replaced jsonwebtoken with jose library for Edge Runtime compatibility
  3. ✅ Updated middleware to use async jwtVerify function
  4. ✅ Made middleware function async to support await operations
- **Security Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Complete login functionality restored
- **Status**: 🔒 **FULLY WORKING** - Admin login now functional at http://localhost:3000/admin/login

### 🔒 Previous Security Fixes - COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Admin routes were accessible without authentication
- **Solution**: 
  1. ✅ Re-enabled API authentication in `/api/clients`
  2. ✅ Created comprehensive Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`)
  3. ✅ Added authentication checks to all admin pages
- **Status**: 🔒 **FULLY SECURED** - All admin routes now properly protected

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Fixed dropdown overflow issue**: kWp quantity selector in Services/Products section
- ✅ **Enhanced responsive design**: Better mobile and desktop layouts
- ✅ **Improved form styling**: Consistent flexbox constraints and positioning

### 📚 Documentation Organization - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Consolidated markdown files**: All documentation moved to docs/ directory
- ✅ **Eliminated duplicates**: Preserved most recent versions, removed redundant files
- ✅ **Streamlined structure**: Easier maintenance and reference

### 🚀 Deployment Workflow Optimization - COMPLETED  
- ✅ **Streamlined environment variables**: Removed unused NextAuth variables
