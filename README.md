## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Cloud account (for deployment)
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArindamTripathi619/apexsolar-app.git
   cd apexsolar-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your database URL and other settings.

4. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will push the schema to your database and seed initial users.

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   - Main site: http://localhost:3000
